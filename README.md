## User Expereince 
The user will click on the grid to try and "hit" the battle ship.  
The field will have the following pieces that all need to be destroyed in order to win:
1 Aircraft carrier 5x1
1 Battleship 4x1
1 Submarine  3x1
2 Destroyer  2x1 

The player should see every grid they've clicked if that "shot" missed there will be an item to indicate a miss.
If the shot hit they should see an item indicate they hit, if they have sunk that ship they should see a damaged ship on the board.
When they player wins they will have an indication that they have won, and they can press reset to play again. 

## Roadmap
Stretch goals:
Transition to a 2 player version of the game
