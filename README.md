## Project status
Currently best played at fullscreen on a 1080p resolution, While the project is complete in its initial form I would like to revisit the following:<br/>
Build in media query functionality to clean up the visuals for mobile or smaller resolutions<br/>
Add in 2 player functionality and make appropriate changes to game such as adding the ship sunk indicator. <br/>
