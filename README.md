## User Expereince 
AAU(As A User) click on the grid to try and "hit" the battle ship.  
The field will have the following pieces that all need to be destroyed in order to win:
<br/>1 Aircraft carrier 5x1
<br/>1 Battleship 4x1
<br/>1 Submarine  3x1
<br/>2 Destroyer  2x1 

AAU you will see every grid you have clicked if that "shot" missed there will be an item to indicate a miss.
AAU if the shot hits you will see an item indicate they hit, if the shot has sunk that ship you will see a damaged/destroyed ship revealed on the board.
